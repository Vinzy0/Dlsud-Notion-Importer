## What is this?

UDScraper is a Chrome extension for **DLSUD students** that pulls your assignments straight from the LMS and sends them to a Notion database — automatically grouped by subject, with due dates, and without any copy-pasting.

No tokens to configure. No spreadsheets to maintain. Just connect your Notion and go.

---

## Features

- 🔐 **One-click Notion login** — OAuth flow, no manual token setup
- 🗂️ **Auto-creates your database** — a "DLSUD Tasks" database is set up in your Notion on first connect
- 📚 **Grouped by subject** — tasks are organized under collapsible subject headers by default
- 📅 **Sort options** — switch between Grouped, Due Date, or Name views
- ✅ **Send selected or sync all** — push just the tasks you want, or sync everything at once
- 🔁 **Duplicate detection** — already-synced tasks are never sent twice
- 📥 **Download tasks** — export your scraped assignments as a local file
- 🌙 **Dark mode** — easy on the eyes during late-night cramming

## How it works

```
DLSUD LMS  ──scrape──▶  Extension  ──OAuth──▶  Cloudflare Worker  ──token──▶  Notion API
```

1. Open the extension on your DLSUD dashboard
2. It scrapes your assignments from the page
3. Hit **Sync All** (or select specific tasks and hit **Send to Notion**)
4. Tasks land in your Notion database, grouped and dated

Your Notion token is exchanged through a Cloudflare Worker — your credentials never touch a third-party server or get stored anywhere except your own device.

## Privacy

All data stays on your device. The only outbound requests are:

- **Notion API** (`api.notion.com`) — to create your task pages
- **Cloudflare Worker** — to securely exchange your OAuth code for a token (no logging, no storage)

No data is ever sold or shared. See the full [privacy policy](privacy-policy.md).
